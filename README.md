# End-to-End-Stock-Analysis-and-Forecasting-With-LSTM-Models

Welcome to an End-to-End Stock Analysis and Forecasting Application
This end-to-end application is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the performance of the Indonesian stock market through in-depth analysis of individual and multiple stocks, as well as forecasting stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models.

Main Features:
1. Stock Analysis:
Single Stock Analysis:
Analyze the performance of individual stocks.
Provide complete metrics including stock price movements, daily returns, and cumulative returns.
Visualize stock price data in easy-to-understand charts.
Calculate and visualize technical metrics such as moving averages (MA) and volatility of stocks.
Compare stock returns against market benchmarks to provide deeper insights into the stock's performance.
Multiple Stock Analysis:
Allows users to compare several stocks at once.
Provides comparative insights into returns between stocks as well as volatility measured over a specific period.
2. Stock Forecasting with LSTM:
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models are used to predict future stock price movements based on historical data.
Model Training:
Users can train the LSTM model on selected stocks.
Users can adjust the model training parameters, including the number of epochs, batch size, and other parameters to enhance forecasting accuracy.
Visualization:
Displays the model training progress graphically to help users understand the model's performance.
Forecast vs Actual Price Comparison: The forecasting results will be compared to the actual stock prices to evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy.
Clear and intuitive forecast results in graphs to help users understand the predicted price movement patterns.
How to Use:
Select a Stock:

Users can select either a single stock or multiple stocks from a provided list.
Perform Analysis:

Use the option to analyze the selected stock(s) and obtain graphs and performance metrics for the stock(s).
Stock Forecasting:

Choose a stock to forecast and adjust the LSTM model parameters as needed.
View the forecasting results and evaluate the model's performance using graphs.
Explore Expert Information:

Users can view information about experts in stock analysis and trading through various available profiles.
